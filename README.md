# My-Portfolio-

The goal of this challenge/project was to create a professional portfolio. 

1. The reason why I made this website was to showcase my HTML and CSS skills and to showcase my work to a potential employer. 

2. I added a photo of myself so the employer can put a face to my name.

3. The links on the top right bring you to the corresponding section of the website. 

4. The projects image will take you to my GitHub page so the employer can see any projects I've been working on. 

5. If you resize the page, the contents on the website will adjust itself on various screens.
